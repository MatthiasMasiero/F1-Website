<h3>
  <FONT COLOR="white"> 
  Nicki Lauda was a very unique driver in his time. Most drivers at his time were risk takers and didnt ferar death, Lauda on the other hand wanted to maximize his safety and cared about how much he was risking when he went into his car. During a very heated point race to win the driver championship against his rival Lauda tried to call off a race in the rain. The other drivers didnt liscen to him so he was forced to race. Later on in that race his car went up into flames and Lauda suffered sever burns. He had to sit out for most of the season watching his Rival Ryan Hunt gain free points. He came back later that season and ended up losing because he stopped mid race in Japan due to dangerouse conditions. He helped show and improve the saftey for drivers in formula one.
